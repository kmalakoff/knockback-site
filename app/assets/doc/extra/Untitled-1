Dear Paulson,

Thank you so much for the offer to join Amazon in the Engineering Manager position. I was excited to learn more about Amazon and the opportunity to work with the PeopleTech teams in a very interesting and important role.

Unfortunately, after giving it a great deal of thought, I have decided to pursue another position and revoke my acceptance of your considerate job offer. I am truly sorry for any inconvenience this decision may cause.

It was a pleasure meeting you. I appreciate all the time you and the extended team spent with me discussing details of the role, sharing the product vision, and learning more about each other. Please convey my decision and regret to Aaron, Anna, Prasanth, Moudy, and Jim. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I wish you success in finding the perfect candidate to fill this position. I hope we have the opportunity to work together in the future.

Sincerely,

Kevin Malakoff
