        p Both Knockout and Backbone have their strengths and weaknesses, but together they are amazing!
        p At the same time you can have the strong ORM provided by Backbone and the dynamic view-models that Knockout.js offers.

            Serialization
            =============

            As you probably know, Backbone is known to have a fantastic syncing system built
            as close as possible to the RESTful pattern. And if this is not good for your
            application you can always opt to build a custom `Backbone.sync` or, if further
            granularity is required, you can customize a Model/Collection's own `sync` function.

            Knockout.js instead does not provide such a feature, and what it offers is a simple
            plugin to map into/from any JSON source.

            Knockback uses Backbone's models and collections, and this means that all the
            serialization features we all love are still there!

        #comparison-2

            Routing
            =======

            In Knockback, while using Knockout.js ViewModel pattern, we developed a full
            pattern that supports Backbone's routing solution.

      section
        #comparison-3
          :markdown
            (Im)proper use of tools
            =======================

            Too often, in a large Backbone application you find yourself building up views
            with too much logic in them, almost always requiring sub-state management. This is
            actually an improper use of views, which should be as logic-less as possible.

            But you *have* to do things like that, and Backbone doesn't help the developer
            solving this (ethical?) issue.

            In Knockout.js, this is not a problem, because ViewModels differ from Views
            exactly in this: they own states, methods and properties allowing the *views* to
            be logic-less.

            So Knockout solves the blurry View/Controller issue you'll find building large
            applications with Backbone. **But** because Knockout simply provides ViewModels and no
            Models, how can you build a proper MVC/MVVM? *Backbone to the rescue!*

            And the circle is complete: Models from Backbone, and Views/ViewModels from
            Knockout.js.

      section
        #comparison-4
          :markdown
            Views' settings
            ===============

            Following MVVM principles where a ViewModel is the "View's Model", and therefore
            owns its own properties and methods which are *then* reflected in the View
            itself, Knockback ViewModels can add View setting and control properties, which are not
            (and should not be!) owned by the model.

            What does this allow? Actual settings (*eg* colors for different priorities in a
            task list) to be applied on all the associated ViewModels, or...something more
            interesting, like an design pattern for localization.

            If you consider localized labels as observed properties, then you can understand
            how Knockback provides internationalization to your applications.
