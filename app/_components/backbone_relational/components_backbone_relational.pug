    =================

    [Backbone-Relational.js](https://github.com/PaulUithol/Backbone-relational/) is an extension to Backbone.js that provides a solution to manage dependencies between Models. Knockback.js has been developed with support for relationships in mind.

    You should take a look at the [Relational-Model Tutorial](tutorial_relational_models.html) for examples of using relationships in your apps including:

    * rendering custom Views for each relationship
    * selecting relationships using an HTML select element and Knockout.js

    Knockback.js really excels at simplifying relationship Views!
